PenaKecil in Indonesian means small pen, this front-end is actually designed to reduce pdf file size but it can also make it bigger due to ghostscript also have options to make it bigger

this tool is currently under development and always expect for some annoying bugs. I planned to do some updates in the future see [TODO list](https://github.com/maslanangdev/PenaKecil/issues/1)

if you interested to test this tool, development builds are available in [releases](https://github.com/maslanangdev/PenaKecil/releases) section (only for Windows, sorry. I am still working on Linux support so if you're Linux user, please be patient)
